# About

Saw a similar site on a job seeker's resume, with a country search, and enthusiastic feedback about it.

Decided to implement my own similar site, and further improve it a little bit.
For this I had to remember Python and parsed several hundred pages with information about visas, save to JSON files, thus creating my own API.

Thus appeared the world map and the ability to move to information about the country immediately from the map, links to the countries bordering the search country, the history of transitions.
Later added the ability to search for information about the need to obtain a visa to visit the country on the basis of nationality of the tourist.


This site will allow users to learn information about different countries of the world, and offers the following features:

    Map: the user can select the country they want on the world map to get information about it.

    Search: the user can enter a country name or a keyword in the search box to quickly access information about a particular country.

    Country page: each country page will contain useful information such as general information about the country, geographical coordinates, language, currency, etc.

    Visas: for each country, it will indicate whether or not a visa is needed to visit it and what conditions must be met to obtain a visa.

    [Future] News: the site will regularly publish news about the travel industry, as well as updates and changes in legislation in different countries around the world.

Thanks to these features, users will be able to learn more about different countries, help each other in choosing a travel destination and leave their contribution to the development of the travel community.
