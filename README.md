# Countries

Working example:
https://643e7b0f96f371000780ebf0--zingy-blancmange-2b30a1.netlify.app/map

P.S. Some issues in router with navigation from map to country info on localhost in dev mode all works perfectly. ðŸ˜‰

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Further help
